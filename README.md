## Simple calculator on Flutter

The main feature of the project is the **absence of dependencies**. Everything is created
manually, from styles to calculation logic.

`InheritedWidget` is used to control the state of the calculator.

Buttons are processed through callbacks passed to `InheritedWidget`, as well as through strategies
for handling incoming characters. There are 4 separate strategies for processing **point**,
**operators**, **digits** and **percent**.
